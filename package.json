  "description": "Built on the top of the `$http` service, Angularâ€™s `$resource` is a service that lets you interact with RESTful backends easily. `$resource` is very similar to models in Rails. In this tutorial, we're going to make use of a book API that can be found here: `http://daretodiscover.herokuapp.com/books`. The request syntax of the books API follows the same pattern as the wine API that you used yesterday.",
